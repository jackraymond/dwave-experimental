    r"""Determine the learning rate for independent qubits.

    For a qubit offset by :math:`\Phi_{0i}` that is to be corrected by a choice
    of :ref:`flux bias <parameter_qpu_flux_biases>` :math:`\Phi`, a model of
    single-qubit freezeout dictates that magnetization
    :math:`<s_i> = tanh(\frac{\Phi_{0i} + \Phi_i}{T})`, where :math:`T` is the
    effective temperature.

    Assume the unshimmed magnetization to be zero-mean distributed with small
    variance, :math:`\Delta_1`, and a standard sampling-based estimator with
    variance :math:`\Delta_2 = \frac{1}{\text{num_reads}}`. You can then
    determine an update to the flux, :math:`\Phi = l <s_i>_{\text{data}}`, where
    the learning rate :math:`l = T \frac{\Delta_1}{Delta_1 + Delta_2}`. This
    update is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the expected square
    magnetization.

    For correlated spin systems and/or experiments that are not well described
    by thermal freezeout, a data-driven approach is recommended to determining
    the schedule and related parameters. The freezeout (Boltzmann) distribution
    can be extended to correlated models, wherein the covariance matrix plays a
    role in determining the optimal learning rate. A single qubit rate can
    remain a good approximation given weakly correlated spins.

    Args:
        eff_temp_phi:
            Effective (unitless) inverse temperature at freezeout. This
            can be determined from current device parameters.
        flux_associated_variance:
            The expected variance of the magnetization (:math:`m`) due to flux
            offset.
        estimator_variance:
            The expected variance in the magnetization estimate,
            :math:`\frac{1-m^2}{\text{num_reads}}`.
        unit_conversion:
            Conversion from units of :ref:`h <parameter_qpu_h>` to units of
            :math:`\Phi` can be determined from published device parameters. See
            :func:`~dwave.system.temperatures.h_to_fluxbias`.
    Returns:
        An appropriate scale for the learning rate, minimizing the expected
        square magnetization.

    Example:
        Determining an :math:`\alpha_\Phi` appropriate for forward anneal of a
        weakly coupled system, ``Advantage_system4.1`` based on published
        parameters. Note that defaults (by contrast) are determined based on
        published values for ``Advantage2_system1.3``.

    r"""Return flux biases that minimize magnetization for symmetry-preserving
    experiments.

    You can refine calibration for specific QPU experiments by modifying your
    QPU programming. The :ref:`flux bias <parameter_qpu_flux_biases>` parameter
    compensates for low-frequency environmental spins that couple into qubits,
    distorting the target distribution. Although you can modify either
    :ref:`flux bias <parameter_qpu_flux_biases>` or :ref:`h <parameter_qpu_h>`
    to restore symmetry of the sampled distribution, flux biases more accurately
    eliminate common forms of low-frequency noise.

    Assuming the magnetization (expectation for measured spins, or sign of the
    persistent current) is a smooth, monotonic function of the qubit body's
    magnetic fluxes (:ref:`flux bias <parameter_qpu_flux_biases>`), you can
    determine parameters that achieve a target magnetization, :math:`m`, by
    iterating :math:`\Phi(t+1) \leftarrow \Phi(t) - L(t) (<s> - m)`, where
    :math:`L(t)` is an iteration-dependent map, :math:`<s>` is the expected
    magnetization, :math:`m` is the target magnetization, and :math:`\Phi` are
    the programmed flux biases.

    By default :math:`L(t)` is uniform with respect to programmed qubits, and
    determined by a
    `hypergradient descent method <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1703.04782>`_.
    Alternatively you can specify the learning rate as a list, in which
    case the hypergradient method is not used.

    Symmetry can be broken by the choice of initial condition in reverse
    annealing, non-zero :math:`h`, :ref:`parameter_polarizing_schedule`, or
    non-zero flux biases over unshimmed fluxes. You can collect data for two
    experiments, with inverted symmetry breaking between them, anticipating zero
    magnetization in the experimental average rather than per experiment.
    Shimming based on this symmetrized data set is expected to determine a good
    shim for both experiments, assuming a weak dependence of noise on the
    symmetry-breaking field.

    Where strong correlations, or strong symmetry-breaking effects, are present
    in an experiment, the sampled distribution may contain insufficient
    information to independently shim all degrees of freedom. Shims are expected
    to be a smooth function of annealing parameters such as
    :ref:`annealing time <parameter_qpu_annealing_time>`,
    :ref:`anneal schedule <parameter_qpu_anneal_schedule>`, and
    Hamiltonian parameters. You can use shims inferred in smoothly related
    models as approximations (or initial conditions) for searches in target
    models.

    If the provided learning rate or learning schedule is too large, it is
    possible to exceed the bounds of allowed values for the flux-bias offsets.

    Args:
        bqm: A :class:`~dimod.binary.BinaryQuadraticModel`.
        sampler: A :class:`~dwave.system.samplers.DWaveSampler`.
        sampling_params: Parameters of the
            :class:`~dwave.system.samplers.DWaveSampler`. Note that if
            ``sampling_params`` contains
            :ref:`flux biases <parameter_qpu_flux_biases>`, these are treated as
            an initial condition and edited in place. Chose a value for the
            :ref:`parameter_qpu_num_reads` parameter in conjunction with your
            chosen schedule. Note that, the :ref:`parameter_qpu_initial_state`
            parameter, if provided, is assumed to be specified according the
            Ising model convention (:math:`\pm 1`, and :math:`-3` for inactive).
        shimmed_variables: A list of variables to shim; by default the shimmed variables
            are inferred from `exp_weights_per_update` or set to all elements
            in :attr:`~dimod.binary.BinaryQuadraticModel.variables`.
        learning_schedule: An iterable of gradient-descent prefactors. When not
            provided, prefactors are determined by a hypergradient-descent
            method parameterized by the ``alpha``, ``beta_hypergradient``, and
            ``num_steps`` arguments.
        convergence_test: A callable that take the history of magnetizations and
            flux biases as input, returning ``True`` to exit the search, and
            ``False`` otherwise. By default, all stages specified in the
            ``learning_schedule`` argument are completed.
        symmetrize_experiments: If True, performs a test to determine symmetry
            breaking in the experiment: a non-zero
            :ref:`parameter_qpu_initial_state` for reverse anneal, non-zero
            :math:`h`, or non-zero :ref:`parameter_qpu_flux_biases` (on some
            shimmed variables). If any of these are present, magnetization is
            inferred by averaging over two experiments with symmetry-breaking
            elements inverted. The shim averages the symmetrically related
            experiments to achieve zero magnetization.
        sampling_params_updates: Where you require averaging across many
            experiments, you can specify a list of updates. Each element in your
            list is a dictionary that updates the ``sampling_params`` argument.
            Experiments are averaged over these sampling-parameter updates to
            determine the magnetization used in shimming. The original value of
            the updated sampling parameter is ignored. The
            :ref:`parameter_qpu_flux_biases` parameter must not be an
            updated parameter. See the
            `examples directory <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-experimental/tree/main/examples>`_
            for use cases.
        beta_hypergradient: Controls the learning rate evolution for the
            hypergradient-descent method, enabling improved performance through
            customizing for the annealing protocol and QPU. Supported values are
            in range :math:`(0,1)`. Ignored if you specify the
            ``learning_schedule`` argument.
        num_steps: Number of steps taken by the hypergradient-descent method if
            you do not specify a ``learning_schedule`` from which to infer.
            Default is 10 if neither is specified.
        alpha: Initial learning rate for the hypergradient-descent method,
            enabling improved performance through customizing for the annealing
            protocol and QPU. Supported values are positive, real floats with a
            typical scale you can determine using the
            :func:`.qubit_freezeout_alpha_phi` function. By default, initialized
            using the :func:`.qubit_freezeout_alpha_phi` function. Ignored if
            you specify the ``learning_schedule`` argument.
        exp_weights_per_update: A weighted sum of magnetizations determines the
            update applied to each variable. Shimmed variables are provided as
            the keys, with a sequence of per-experiment weights as the value.
            When provided, keys must match ``shimmed_variables`` and each
            weight sequence must have length
            ``num_signed_experiments * len(sampling_params_updates)``.
            By default, a mean of experimental outcomes is used.

    Returns:
        A tuple consisting of 3 parts:
            1.  Flux biases in a list using the :ref:`parameter_qpu_flux_biases`
                format (for use by a
                :class:`~dwave.system.samplers.DWaveSampler` sampler).
            2.  History of flux-bias assignments per shimmed component.
            3.  History of magnetizations per shimmed component.

    """Shim flux biases using paired target and detector annealing lines.

    Coupled qubits can act as complimentary detectors. If we assume the required
    calibration refinement does not depend on the target/detector waveforms
    for example that bias is determined by static flux offsets at a mid
    point of the dynamics, the we can iterate a pair of experiments (role
    of detector) to determine a calibration refinement both of the target
    and detector system.

    We assume flux biases required are weakly dependent on the choice
    of ``x_anneal_schedules``. We can measure the coupled system(s)
    of qubits alternating the role of detector. Assuming
    :math:`d\langle m_D\rangle/d\Phi_D > -\mathrm{sign}(J_{SD})\,d\langle m_D\rangle/d\Phi_S > 0`,
    we can pursue paired experiments and update only detector qubit fluxes
    in each with a convergence guarantee.

    When ``shimmed_variables`` contains at least one variable assigned to a
    target line, two experiments per iteration are run with detector and
    target roles alternated (via swapped ``x_anneal_schedules`` and
    ``x_schedule_delays``), and the update for each variable uses only the
    experiment in which it plays the detector role. When ``shimmed_variables``
    contains only detector variables, no alternation is performed and shimming
    reduces to a single-experiment call to :func:`.shim_flux_biases`.

    Note that under similar assumptions, we can reverse the roles of source and
    detector to shim the source flux_bias as well.

    Args:
        bqm: A :class:`~dimod.binary.BinaryQuadraticModel` describing the
            coupled target-detector(-source) system. A source line is optional.
        sampler: A :class:`~dwave.system.samplers.DWaveSampler`.
        target_lines: Indices of annealing lines whose qubits act as targets
            (the system whose state we wish to measure). By default bqm
            variables on these lines are shimmed, shimmed_variables can be
            used to narrow the set, and if no target lines are included
            a simpler shim on detector qubits only is performed.
        detector_lines: Indices of annealing lines whose qubits act as
            detectors. By default all bqm qubits on the detector lines are
            shimmed, but the set can be reduced using the shim_variables
            parameter.
        line_assignments: Maps each variable (qubit index) to its annealing
            line index.
        sampling_params: Base sampling parameters passed to the sampler.
            If not specified, then defaults are used. A minimal set of
            functional parameters should include ``x_anneal_schedules`` and
            ``num_reads``.
        learning_schedule: An iterable of gradient-descent prefactors for the
            underlying :func:`.shim_flux_biases` call. When not provided, the
            hypergradient-descent method is used.
        convergence_test: A callable that takes the history of magnetizations
            and flux biases and returns ``True`` to exit the search early.
        symmetrize_experiments: If ``True``, symmetry-breaking elements in the
            experiment are inverted for a second run and magnetizations are
            averaged. Passed through to :func:`.shim_flux_biases` for the
            optimization. Default is ``False``.
        beta_hypergradient: Controls the learning-rate evolution for the
            hypergradient-descent method. Supported values are in
            :math:`(0, 1)`. Ignored when ``learning_schedule`` is provided.
        num_steps: Number of gradient-descent steps. Default is 10.
        alpha: Initial learning rate for the hypergradient-descent method.
            See :func:`.shim_flux_biases`.
        shimmed_variables: Variables to shim, which defaults to all variables in
            ``bqm`` that are assigned to ``target_lines`` or ``detector_lines``.
            If provided, only these variables are included in the two-line
            update scheme, and they must be a subset of variables assigned to
            ``target_lines`` or ``detector_lines``.
        set_unused_lines_to_zero: If ``True``, lines outside
            ``target_lines`` and ``detector_lines`` are neutralized by setting
            ``x_anneal_schedules`` to zero-valued schedules, setting
            ``x_polarizing_schedule`` to zero, and setting
            ``x_schedule_delays`` to zero.
        decouple_tar_and_det: If ``True``, a copy of ``bqm`` restricted to
            variables assigned to ``target_lines`` or ``detector_lines`` is
            used for shimming. This decouples the target-detector system
            from any residual couplings to qubits on other annealing lines.
            The caller's ``bqm`` is not modified. Default is ``True``.
        exp_feature_line_info: If ``sampling_params`` is not provided, this
            is used to parameterize ``x_anneal_schedules``.
        target_c: If ``sampling_params`` is not provided, this is used
           to parameterize x_anneal_schedules for ``target_lines``.
        num_reads: If ``sampling_params`` is not provided, this is used to
            set the default number of reads per iterative stage. Larger
            values result in lower variance (better) convergence.
    Returns:
        A tuple of three parts mirroring the return value of
        :func:`.shim_flux_biases`:

        1.  Flux biases in the :ref:`parameter_qpu_flux_biases` format
            for use with QPU sampling.
        2.  History of flux-bias assignments per shimmed component
            across iterations.
        3.  History of magnetizations per variable across experiments
            and iterations.
