    r"""Greedy node-level quotient search.

    Subgraph isomorphisms (1:1 embeddings) are searched subject to the restriction that nodes in the
    source are mapped to nodes in the target aligned subject to the constraint of matched quotient
    graph structure.

    The following case describes specifically zephyr graphs, but the general approach applies to
    chimera and pegasus graphs with the appropriate quotient graph structure and coordinate conventions.
    
    The source and target are viewed in quotient blocks indexed by :math:`(u, w, j, z)`, each
    containing :math:`tp` source nodes. For each block, we propose target nodes with the same
    :math:`(u, w, j, z)` and varying target :math:`k`, optionally augmented with boundary proposals.

    The scoring objective is:

    .. math::

        \operatorname{score}(p) =
        \begin{cases}
        \sum\limits_{n \in B} \mathbf{1}[p_n \in V(T)] & \text{node yield}\\
        \sum\limits_{(n,m) \in E(S_B, S_\text{fixed})}
        \mathbf{1}[(p_n, \phi(m)) \in E(T)] & \text{edge yield}
        \end{cases}

    For a fixed quotient index :math:`q = (u, w, j, z)`, define the source block :math:`B_q` as

    .. math::

        B_q = \{(u, w, k, j, z) : k \in \{0, \dots, tp-1\}\}.

    A proposal :math:`p` is an assignment on that block, :math:`p: B_q \to V(T)`, and can be
    viewed as a length-``tp`` vector :math:`(p_0, \dots, p_{tp-1})` where :math:`p_k` is the
    proposed target node for source node :math:`(u, w, k, j, z)`.

    Here :math:`T` is the target graph, :math:`V(T)` is its node set, and :math:`E(T)` is its edge
    set. Let :math:`S` be the source graph and define the already-fixed outside set

    .. math::

        F_q = \{m \in V(S) \setminus B_q : m \in \operatorname{dom}(\phi)\},

    where :math:`\phi` is the current embedding. Then

    .. math::

        E(S_B, S_\text{fixed})
        := \{(n,m) \in E(S) : n \in B_q,\ m \in F_q\},

    i.e., the source edges that cross from the current block to already-fixed source nodes outside
    the block.

    In other words, node yield counts how many proposed nodes :math:`p_n` are present in
    :math:`V(T)`; while edge yield counts how many source edges crossing from the current block to
    already-fixed nodes are preserved as target edges :math:`(p_n, \phi(m)) \in E(T)`.

    Yield types in this node-level search are interpreted as follows: ``"node"`` maximises target
    node presence for each proposed block; ``"edge"`` maximises preserved cross-block
    source-to-fixed edge connectivity; and ``"rail-edge"`` follows the same node-level scoring as
    ``"edge"`` in this function (the distinction between ``"edge"`` and ``"rail-edge"`` is made
    in rail-level search).

    Args:
        source: Coordinate-labeled graph. 
        target: Coordinate-labeled graph. The family should be matched to the source family.
        embedding: Current mapping, updated in-place.
        expand_boundary_search: This argument
            is only applicable to Zephyr graph applications, and is ignored for Pegasus and
            Chimera graph families. If ``True``, allow mappings from boundary quotient nodes to
            adjacent (internal perpendicular block offset) nodes. Defaults to ``True``.
        ksymmetric: If ``True``, assume the order of source ``k`` indices is interchangeable
            for scoring and use top-``tp`` selection. Defaults to ``False``.
        yield_type: ``"node"``, ``"edge"``, or ``"rail-edge"``. Defaults to ``"edge"``.

    Returns:
        Updated embedding.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If graph geometry metadata is inconsistent.
            This includes source/target family mismatch and unsupported geometry assumptions.

    r"""Greedy rail-level quotient search for Zephyr, Chimera and Pegasus graphs.

    Implementation status: rail-level search supports Zephyr, Chimera, and Pegasus coordinate
    families.

    Rails are connected components that consist of connected node sequences of the same orientation:
    vertical (u=0) or horizontal (u=1) qubits. After removal of internal edges (those that connect
    qubits of differing orientation) rails are disconnected graph components.

    Rails are indexed by :math:`(u, w, k)`, where ``u`` denotes ``orientation`` and ``w`` denotes
    ``orthogonal_displacement``. For Zephyr these match the standard coordinate system.
    Zephyr rails contain all qubits (u, w, k, *, *).
    Chimera rails contain (*, w, u, k) for u=0, (w, *, u, k) for u=1.
    Pegasus rails contain (u, w//6, (2 w)%12 + k, *)

    Rails that differ only in the k index are related by automorphism in the fully-yielded graph.
    This code greedily searches for a mapping (1:1 embedding) of rails on the source graph to rails on the larger graph
    in order to maximize some objective outcome like edge-yield.

    The following description applies to Zephyr, but generalizes qualitatively to Chimera and Pegasus
    graphs:
    .. math::

        \mathcal{R}^{S}_{u,w} := \{(u, w, k_s) : k_s \in \{0, \dots, t_p-1\}\}.

    The search chooses :math:`t_p` target rails for each family :math:`\mathcal{R}^{S}_{u,w}`
    from candidate rails optionally augmented at boundaries (:math:`w=0` and :math:`w=2m`) using
    adjacent interior perpendicular block offsets.

    Let the target rail indexed by :math:`(u, w_t, k_t)` be

    .. math::

        R^{T}_{u,w_t,k_t} :=
        \{(u, w_t, k_t, j, z) : j \in \{0,1\},\ z \in \{0,\dots,m-1\}\}.

    We can define its objective for ``yield_type='edge'`` as the number of edges preserved within
    that rail, i.e., the number of edges in the target subgraph induced by the proposed rail, or
    equivalently the number of edges in the source rail (which is fixed) that are preserved by the
    proposal:

    .. math::

        Q(u,w_t,k_t) := |E(T[R^{T}_{u,w_t,k_t}])|,

    or, for ``yield_type='node'``, the number of present target nodes in that rail. Here :math:`T`
    is the target graph and :math:`E(T[R])` is the edge set of the target subgraph induced by node
    set :math:`R`.
    For ``yield_type='edge'``, each proposal also gets an external connectivity term counting
    preserved edges from already-embedded neighbouring source nodes into the proposed target rail.

    .. math::

        \operatorname{score}(u,w_t,k_t)
        = Q(u,w_t,k_t)
        + \sum \mathbf{1}[\text{external source edge maps to a target edge}].

    Depending on ``ksymmetric``, the algorithm either selects the top :math:`t_p` rail proposals by
    score (treating source :math:`k` order as interchangeable), or evaluates permutations assigning
    proposal rails to source indices :math:`k_s \in \{0,\dots,t_p-1\}`.

    Yield types in this rail-level search are interpreted as follows: ``"node"`` scores each
    proposal rail by the number of present target nodes in that rail. ``"edge"`` prefers rails
    that both have many internal rail edges and connect well to already-embedded neighbouring
    rails. ``"rail-edge"`` focuses first on how good the rail itself is, measured by the number of
    target edges inside that rail; when permutations are evaluated, it also includes the same
    already-embedded neighbour consistency term as ``"edge"``.

    Example: suppose two candidate target rails have the same internal rail structure, but one of
    them has more edges to neighbouring rails that are already fixed in the embedding. Then
    ``"edge"`` prefers that better-connected rail, while ``"rail-edge"`` treats the two rails as
    equivalent in the top-rail selection path because it only compares their internal rail
    structure there.

    Selected rails are then expanded back to node assignments for all :math:`(j,z)` in
    each source rail.

    Args:
        source: Coordinate-labeled source graph.
        target: Coordinate-labeled target graph.
        embedding: Current mapping, updated in-place.
        expand_boundary_search: If ``True``, include adjacent rail
            proposals when :math:`w` is at a boundary. Defaults to ``True``. Boundary expansion
            is only relevant for Zephyr, it is ignored for other graph families.
        ksymmetric: If ``True``, treat source :math:`k` order as interchangeable when scoring
            rails. Defaults to ``False``.
        yield_type: ``"node"``, ``"edge"``, or ``"rail-edge"``. Defaults to ``"edge"``.

    Returns:
        Updated embedding.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If duplicate target assignments are produced.
        ValueError: If graph family is unknown.

    r"""Compute a high-yield quotient embedding for supported D-Wave graph families.

    This routine starts from a source graph with ``m`` rows and tile size ``tp``,
    and maps it into a target graph with the same ``m`` rows and tile size ``t >= tp``.
    It is designed for defective targets where a direct identity map may lose
    nodes or edges. Since a greedy method is used for embedding search, it is possible it fails to
    find a 1:1 embedding where one is viable. A complete method such as
    :code:``minorminer.subgraph.find_subgraph`` may be more appropriate in a scenario such as this,
    especially with customization of parameters to the target families. Similarly, when defect rates
    are high direct use of the :code:``minorminer.find_embedding`` heuristic may be a more efficient
    strategy (it will typically return a 1-to-many embedding in such cases).

    The quotient construction and greedy update rules in this implementation are based on Zephyr,
    Pegasus or Chimera coordinate blocks presented in the D-Wave networkx format.

    The search is organized around the **quotient graph** of the topology, formed by
    contracting fine-grained coordinate indices so that each equivalence class maps to a single
    quotient node. Two coarsenings are used:

    - **Quotient node** block :math:`(u, w, j, z)`: groups the ``tp`` source nodes that share
      orientation ``u``, perpendicular block offset ``w``, shift identifier ``j``, and parallel
      tile offset ``z`` but differ in qubit index :math:`k \in \{0, \dots, tp-1\}`.
    - **Quotient rail** block :math:`(u, w)`: groups all :math:`2 m \cdot tp` nodes that share
      orientation ``u`` and perpendicular block offset ``w`` (i.e. a whole Zephyr rail family)
      before any :math:`(k, j, z)` variation.

    The function can be used in (1) node-level mode (``search_strategy='by_quotient_node'``), where
    each quotient node block :math:`(u,w,j,z)` is optimized by choosing target candidates with the
    same :math:`(u,w,j,z)` and selecting the highest-yield proposals; (2) rail-level mode
    (``search_strategy='by_quotient_rail'``): optimise each quotient rail block :math:`(u,w,:)` by
    selecting rails :math:`(u,w_t,k_t)` that maximise yield.; and (3) hybrid mode
    (``search_strategy='by_rail_then_node'``): rail search followed by node refinement.

    Family-specific support status:
        - Zephyr and Chimera: support all three search strategies.
        - Pegasus: supports all three strategies in the implemented quotient setting
            (``tp=1``, ``t=2``).

    When ``expand_boundary_search=True``, boundary perpendicular block offsets ``w=0`` and
    ``w=2m`` are augmented using proposals drawn from adjacent internal perpendicular block
    offsets. Whenever this behaviour is activated, nodes from the internal perpendicular block
    offsets are assigned first, so that the unassigned nodes in the internal perpendicular block
    offsets adjacent to the boundaries can be considered as proposals when optimising the
    boundary perpendicular block offsets.

    Yield types control what the greedy search tries to preserve. ``"node"`` tries to place as
    many source nodes as possible onto target nodes that actually exist. ``"edge"`` tries to
    preserve source edges throughout the search. ``"rail-edge"`` is a mixed strategy: during rail
    search it first prefers rails that are internally well-formed, and if a node-refinement phase
    runs afterward it switches to ordinary edge-preservation scoring. The final yield for both
    ``"edge"`` and ``"rail-edge"`` is reported as a number of preserved source edges.

    Multi-family API note: this function accepts Zephyr/Pegasus/Chimera graph metadata and
    coordinate-form embedding validation at the API boundary. Strategy coverage is implemented for
    Zephyr, Chimera, and Pegasus (with the Pegasus quotient-search constraints above).

    Args:
        source: Source graph (linear or coordinate labels) from a supported D-Wave topology
            family: ``'zephyr'``, ``'pegasus'``, or ``'chimera'``.
        target: Target graph (linear or coordinate labels) from a supported D-Wave topology
            family: ``'zephyr'``, ``'pegasus'``, or ``'chimera'``.
        search_strategy: Search strategy. One of ``'by_quotient_rail'``,
            ``'by_quotient_node'``, or ``'by_rail_then_node'``. See full docstrings for a
            description of these. Defaults to ``'by_quotient_rail'``.
        embedding: Optional initial one-to-one chain mapping. If omitted,
            the identity on source coordinate indices is used (wrapped in singleton chains).
            Defaults to ``None``. This must be a chain mapping where each source node maps to
            a singleton tuple target chain, e.g. ``{source_node: (target_node,)}``.
        expand_boundary_search: Enable additional boundary proposals. Defaults to ``True``.
        ksymmetric: Assume source ``k`` ordering can be treated symmetrically during greedy
            selection when valid. Defaults to ``False``.
        yield_type: Optimization objective: ``'node'``, ``'edge'``, or ``'rail-edge'``.
            See full docstrings for a description of these. Defaults to ``'edge'``.

    Returns:
        A pruned one-to-one chain embedding of the form ``source_node -> (target_node,)`` (singleton
        chains) that contains only mappings whose target node exists in the target, and a
        :class:`QuotientSearchMetadata` namedtuple with fields ``max_num_yielded``,
        ``starting_num_yielded``, and ``final_num_yielded``.

    .. note::
        If you want to embed a Zephyr graph with parameter ``mp`` < ``m``, where ``m`` is the row
        count of the target, you can use
        ``minorminer.utils.parallel_embeddings.find_sublattice_embeddings`` to locate a compatible
        ``mp``-row sublattice first, then pass that induced subgraph as the target.

            import dwave.graphs as dnx

            # Build an mp-row Zephyr tile and locate it in the original target.
            tile = dnx.zephyr_graph(mp, target.graph["tile"], coordinates=True)
            tile_embs = find_sublattice_embeddings(
                S=tile,
                T=target,
                max_num_emb=1,

            )

            if tile_embs:
                tile_to_target = tile_embs[0]  # pick the first one
                mp_nodes = set(tile_to_target.values())
                target_mp = target.subgraph(mp_nodes).copy()

                # Relabel to canonical mp coordinates expected by source/target metadata.
                target_to_tile = {tgt: tile_n for tile_n, tgt in tile_to_target.items()}
                target_mp = nx.relabel_nodes(target_mp, target_to_tile, copy=True)
                target_mp.graph.update(family="zephyr", rows=mp, tile=target.graph["tile"],
                                       labels="coordinate")

                emb_mp, metadata = search_strategy(source, target_mp)

                # Map the final embedding back to the original target labels.

                }

        If you want to refine a non-full-yield result with an external solver, run
        :func:`search_strategy` first and only call the refinement routine when
        ``metadata.final_num_yielded < metadata.max_num_yielded``.
